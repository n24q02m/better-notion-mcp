```

### create (new discussion)
```json
{"action": "create", "page_id": "xxx", "content": "Great work!"}
```

```

## Parameters

- `comment_id` - Comment ID (for get action)
- `discussion_id` - Discussion ID (for replies)
- `content` - Comment content

## Known Limitations

### comments.list returns 404 (OAuth Bug)
As of 2025-09-03, the Notion API may return a 404 error when attempting to list comments using an OAuth token, even if the page exists and has comments. This is a known issue with the Notion API itself.

**Workarounds:**
1. **Use action: "get"** - If you have a specific `comment_id`, you can still retrieve it directly.
2. **Use action: "create"** - Creating new comments or replying to discussions via `discussion_id` is unaffected and works as expected.
